# Life Expectancy & GDP Analysis

This project explores the correlation between a nation's GDP and the life expectancy of its citizens. The analysis includes data from six nations and covers the years 2000 to 2015.

## Key Objectives

- Determine if life expectancy increased over time in the six nations.
- Examine GDP trends over the same period.
- Explore the correlation between GDP and life expectancy.
- Calculate the average life expectancy in the dataset.
- Analyze the distribution of life expectancy.

## Data Sources

- GDP data: World Bank national accounts and OECD National Accounts.
- Life Expectancy data: World Health Organization.

## Project Stages

1. Data import and preparation.
2. Exploratory data analysis, including visualizations.
3. Conclusions and insights.

## Findings

- Life expectancy increased over time, with Zimbabwe showing the most significant improvement.
- All nations experienced GDP growth, with China leading.
- There's a positive correlation between GDP and life expectancy.
- Average life expectancy ranges from mid to high 70s, except for Zimbabwe (50).
- Life expectancy data has a left-skewed distribution.

## Further Research

The project suggests exploring factors contributing to China's remarkable GDP growth, including population size, capital availability, and manufacturing efficiency.
