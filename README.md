# Project Report: **LIFE EXPECTANCY & GDP**

*Exploring the Correlation Between Economic Productivity and Life Expectancy*

*By Waqas*

---

## **Overview**

In this project, we delve into the relationship between a nation's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and the life expectancy of its citizens. Our aim is to understand this connection, which can be valuable for policymakers seeking to improve public health and societal well-being.

### **Objective**

The project is structured to achieve the following objectives:

1. Determine if life expectancy has increased over time in six nations.
2. Examine whether GDP has grown over time in the same set of nations.
3. Explore the correlation between a country's GDP and its life expectancy.
4. Calculate the average life expectancy in these nations.
5. Analyze the distribution of life expectancy within the dataset.

## **Data Sources**

The dataset consists of information from six nations:

- GDP Source: World Bank national accounts data and OECD National Accounts data files.
- Life Expectancy Data Source: World Health Organization.

---

## **Stages**

### **Stage 1: Import Python Modules & Data**

First, we import the necessary Python modules and load the dataset.

An examination of the dataset reveals 96 rows and 4 columns.

---

### **Stage 2: Explore the Data**

Let's explore the dataset to gain insights.

#### Countries in the Dataset

The dataset includes data from six countries: Chile, China, Germany, Mexico, the United States of America, and Zimbabwe.

#### Years Covered

The data spans the years 2000 to 2015.

### **Stage 3: Conclusion & Insights**

This project was able to create numerous data visualizations with the data, despite having only 96 rows and 4 columns.

The project successfully addressed some of the initial questions:

1. Has life expectancy increased over time in the six nations?

   Yes, with *Zimbabwe* experiencing the greatest increase.

2. Has GDP increased over time in the six nations?

   GDP has been increased for all countries in our list, especially for *China*.

3. Is there a correlation between GDP and life expectancy of a country?

   Yes, there is a positive correlation between GDP and life expectancy for countries in our list.

4. What is the average life expectancy in these nations?

   Average life expectancy was between mid to high 70s for most countries, except for *Zimbabwe, which was 50*.

5. What is the distribution of that life expectancy?

   The life expectancy had a left skew, with most of the observations on the right side.

### **Further Research**

The study aimed to explore the factors contributing to the drastic increase in GDP in China over the past 10 years.

According to a Forbes article, China's unmatched GDP growth in the past decades was attributed to its large population, newly available capital, and manufacturing efficiency.

The study can confirm that the findings in the data align with the real-world findings for GDP growth in China.
